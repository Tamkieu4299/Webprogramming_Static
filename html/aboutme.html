					Before taking myself into the IT world, my major was
					Economics Relation at Foreign Trade University. <br />I known me
					of the old days struggled with stuffs unsatisfied myself.
					I made one of the most important decisions - <br />being a
					Software Developer. Although It is quite late, but I believe
					with our hardworking there's nothing we cannot do.
					<br />
					<br />
					Before studying as an IT student, I majored in Economics
					Relation at Foreign Trade University which had lots of
					course <br />developing critical and creative thinkings.
					Therefore I will never afraid of changes and improvements.
					And as I have been <br />a Business student, in some cases, I know
					how to develop to meet the end user's satisfaction.

					<br />
					Following my passion in technology, I made my biggest change
					in my life - enrolling in RMIT as an IT student. <br />I studied
					8-10 hours a day, beside tasks and knowledges
					from school, I spend almost the study time to teach myself
					about <br />the Algorithm through LeetCode, Frontend and backend
					frameworks through online tutorials.
					I will never stop learning new things.
